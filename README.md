# Python Pomodoro

A simple pomodoro timer application used in the command line written in Python.

I chose to do this project in order to learn more about command line interface tooling. I find CLIs fascinating and wanted to understand what is happening behind the scenes.

<!-- Contemplated CLI vs TUI -->

<!--
Used `uv` to manage dependencies and the virtual environment.
Created the project using `uv init --package python_pomodoro`
The `--package`` flag creates a `src` and a module directory, an `__init__.py` in the module directory, adds a build system, and creates a command(?).
